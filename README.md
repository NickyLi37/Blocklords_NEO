**BLOCKLORDS**


BLOCKLORDS takes gamers to a medieval time when power was determined through strength, cunning and the ability to use your wealth against others. Starting in the year 700 AD, players will be thrown into the dark ages and must do whatever it takes to survive. Alone you are weak, together you are strong, and you must fight to prevail! 

**HEROES** 
1. When starting the game, each player will get to choose one of three totally randomized heroes. The player can choose his/her favorite option. Once a commander is selected and the player agrees, that character will be created on the blockchain along with the date of birth, power stats, and inherited starting items. 
2. Heroes can be equipped with items which will increase their stats and change their appearance. Items include but are not limited to: weapons, helmet, armor, fine clothing, boots, and accessories with many uses. New items can be acquired through winning battles, purchasing at shops, or crafting them yourself. 
3. When a character is created on the blockchain, he/she is also assigned a birth area and nationality within one of the existing countries (players will not be able to select their nations in order to maintain balance within the game). The player will start as a warrior of fighting age within the walls of his birth city.  
 
**BATTLES** 

1. The game is mainly about fighting battles. There are 3 types of battles: 1) Battles against raiders (NPC or players), 2) Battles against enemy nations (requires formal declaration of war from the nation’s leaders), and 3) Battles against citizens of your nation (Which will cause a rebellion or make you a bandit).     
2. The outcome of battles is determined by several factors and modifiers (See HOI, STELLARIS, RISK). The primary modifiers will be: the size of your army (FOLLOWERS), its equipment, planning, and speed. 
3. Battles between small bands of warriors will last only for minutes, whereas large-scale battles involving thousands of soldiers could last hours/days. During battles, players will be able to take some action to change the outcome, but at the end of the day it will be primarily based on stats and luck.  
4. Battles will end either when a commander retreats by player choice, or if his/her army is overwhelmed. The winning commander will earn followers, financial resources, and 2 randomly selected items from his enemy. Instead of retreating, players can choose to submit to the enemy commander. This will cost the player their most valuable item as tribute as well as a monthly/yearly tax payment to his/her lord. 5. All battle records and spoils will be stored on blockchain. This will create a historic record for players to consult. Any hero or item that took part in the battle will also get the battle stats added to his/her record.   
 
**CITIES** 
1. The world map will be filled with minor and major cities that can be attacked and occupied either through acts of war or rebellion. Whoever conquers a city will have full control over its buildings and defenses, as well as authority over who is allowed to enter the city. City Lords will have full control of resources generated by the city, but must pay taxes to his/her nation’s leader (unless he/she is in full rebellion). 
2. Players will be able to construct buildings within the walls of their cities as long as they are citizens in good standing (and have paid taxes to their lords). Buildings can serve many functions, and grant players the ability to pursue a particular occupation, store items, and have offspring.   

**OCCUPATIONS** 
1. Though most of the player base will consist of warlords focused on conquest, there will be many other activities for players to follow. Craftsmen will be able create unique new items, priests will grant powerful buffs, doctors will heal wounded heroes, merchants will be able to run shops, and much more!  2. In order to acquire a particular vocation, a hero will have to earn this vocation and possibly have to go through an apprenticeship. Occupations will be a great way for players to contribute to the BLOCKLORDS community and also a great way for them to earn new resources and coins that can be monetized.  

**POLITICS, DIPLOMACY & TITLES** 
1. The world will initially be divided into 10 major nations and smaller independent NPC controlled city-states. As the players progress, they can conquer new territories for their nations and bring spoils of wars into the economy. Eventually, all independent territories will be conquered by the major nations and the only way to expand will be to wage war against each other.  
2. Each nation will have its own governance structure that will be entirely controlled by players. Several systems such as monarchies and democracies will be available for players to choose from. A nation’s leader(s) will have full control over the nation’s economy (currency & trade policies), military, diplomacy and also banishment of citizens.  
3. Most players will start the game as commoners, but titles play a big part in the BLOCKLORDS game. Titles determine the player’s ability to govern within his/her city, province and nation. Governors and rulers have the ability to set tax policies, determine war efforts, and fill cabinet positions with trusted allies. If a player is not happy with his/her position, they will have to fight their way to the top to reach the pinnacle of power. 
4. Leaders can decide to control everything directly and can also delegate certain tasks to ministers and courtiers. Courtiers will have full authority over the area that they have been assigned to control until there is a transition of power. 5. Leaders will wield great power, but can also be replaced by their people if they abuse their powers. Warriors can gather together to form an organized rebellion and conquer the capital, and well-funded players can stage coups if they find support from cabinet members.  
 
**MARKETPLACE** 
1. The general marketplace will be run by the BLOCKLORDS team and will be an auction house of sorts for players to sell and buy heroes, titles, cities, buildings and more. This will be a direct way for players to monetize their in-game content in exchange for the LRD token. This token will be a liquid token traded on major exchanges, thus allowing a way for players to profit directly from their time spent in the game.
